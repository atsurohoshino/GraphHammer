Introduction
============

GraphHammer is a graph library inspired by STINGER library.

STINGER introduces a representation that allows for very fast analyses
on Cray XMP.

Our version does not depart in spirit, but depart in implementation.
We aim for a version that allows for fast analyses on conventional
hardware or on cluster machines.
