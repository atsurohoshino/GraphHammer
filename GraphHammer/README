STINGER
-------

STINGER stands for "Spatio-Temporal Spatio-Temporal
Interaction Networks and Graphs (STING) Extensible Representation".

This is a representation that allows for very fast analyses on Cray XMP.

Our version does not depart in spirit, but depart in implementation.
We aim for a version that allows for fast analyses on conventional
hardware or on cluster machines.
