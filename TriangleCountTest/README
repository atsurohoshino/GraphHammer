Triangle Count test
-------------------

TriangleCountTest is a standalone program for our STINGER
implementation. It performs Triangle Count streaming analysis
on specified graph data.

Building
--------

"cabal install --bindir=<your program dir>" should suffice.

It depends on STINGER and Graph500.

Usage
-----

The program requires only one command line argument:
-fname="graph data file". All other parameters are for
tuning execution process and thus optional.
